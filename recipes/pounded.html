    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Pounded Yam and egusi soup recipes are very popular Nigerian cuisine that
      originated in the Kano region. The dish consists of diced yams (sometimes
      topped with ground peanuts) combined with eggplant, which studded with
      garlic, dried pepper, and other spices are pounded to a paste until it is
      formed into a solid block around one or two inches in size. The pounding
      process results in a deep black color of the pounded yam and a nutty,
      earthy, nutty flavor. <br />
      Egusi soup is a Nigerian traditional food, made of chicken and seafood. It
      is eaten with a type of bread called “Jombo”, or before. The soup is
      usually served with bread soaked in peanut or sesame oil. The ingredients
      used to make egusi soup include chicken, fish, and vegetables.
